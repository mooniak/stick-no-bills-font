STICK NO BILLS - is the bespoke typeface of [Stick No Bills™ Poster Gallery](http://sticknobillsonline.com/) in Galle, Sri Lanka.

The first drawings were developed by Martyn Hodges for uppercase and numerals and mooniak is working on further refining and developing them into a font.

See our [blog post](http://blog.mooniak.com/tagged/sticknobillsfont) on the process.
